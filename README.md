# fedora-discourse-theme
Custom theme for discussions.fedoraproject.org

## Getting Started
Follow the steps on https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-using-theme-creator-and-theme-cli-to-start-building-a-discourse-theme/108444 to setup an account for the theme creator, you can either fork/clone this repo and set it up to work on locally or import it directly in to the theme creator and work from there.

## TODO
Most of it :)

I've started work on the colour scheme, header, buttons and banner but they're all in need of refinement.
The font sizes need looking at.
Find a way to make the banner full width instead of being inside the `wrap` container (possibly needs to use a handlebars template instead of HTML).
If using a handlebars template for the banner, look in to using locale strings instead of hardcoding the message.
Mobile/responsive styles, currently the banner is desktop only.
Two column layout
Add extra buttons/links to the header
